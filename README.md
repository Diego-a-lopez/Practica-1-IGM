## Overview:
This README file explains the completion of Assignment 1 for the IGM (Interactive Graphics and Multimedia) course. In this assignment, the task was to add a texture to one of the faces of the cube from the `spinningcube.cpp` file using OpenGL.

## File Details:
The implementation of the assignment can be found in the file named `Practica_1_IGM.cpp`.

## Instructions to Run:
To run the program, simply follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
3. Type the following command:

`make Practica_1_IGM`

4. Press Enter to execute the command.
5. Once the compilation is successful, run the program by typing:

`./Practica_1_IGM`


This will execute the program, demonstrating the spinning cube with the added texture on one of its faces.

**Note:** Ensure that you have OpenGL installed and configured properly on your system before running the program.
